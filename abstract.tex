A Fréchet mean of a random variable $Y$ with values in a metric space $(\mathcal Q, d)$ is an element of the metric space that minimizes $q \mapsto \mathbb E[d(Y,q)^2]$. This minimizer may be non-unique. 
%The Fréchet mean and its generalizations have an extremely wide range of application, including standard statistical methods like mean, median, or maximum likelihood estimation in euclidean spaces and nonstandard applications like finding the center of mass in Riemannian manifolds. 
We study strong laws of large numbers for sets of generalized Fréchet means.
Following generalizations are considered: 
the minimizers of $\mathbb E[d(Y, q)^\alpha]$ for $\alpha > 0$,
the minimizers of $\mathbb E[H(d(Y, q))]$ for integrals $H$ of non-decreasing functions, and
the minimizers of $\mathbb E[\mathfrak c(Y, q)]$ for a quite unrestricted class of cost functions $\mf c$.
We show convergence of empirical versions of these sets in outer limit and in one-sided Hausdorff distance. The derived results require only minimal assumptions.
